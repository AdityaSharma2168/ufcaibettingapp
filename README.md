UFC AI Betting App

This app uses Python and Flask for the back-end, as well as Jupyter Notebooks and csv files for the machine learning aspect.
With this app, I try to attempt to predict the outcome of 3 upcoming fights, with the winners and losers by submission/TKO/KO.
No key integration yet with back-end and front-end, but ML model works.

Disclaimer: ML Model was helped by user kyleskom, ArbiKodraj, and shw-bot.
